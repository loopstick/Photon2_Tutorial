## Hands-on Photon2 Tutorial

**This tutorial created by Sudhu Tewari 2023**
 - from materials originally created by: Michael Shiloh and Judy Castro for *Teach Me To Make*

#### Tutorial overview
The tutorial will focus on getting you up and running with Particle Photon2 quickly, so that you will understand the basic procedures for working with your [Particle Photon2](https://docs.particle.io/photon-2/)

We will cover how to connect your Photon2 to your laptop; how to understand, modify, and write programs (aka code); how to connect input devices and sensors to your Photon2 and read them from a program; and how to connect actuators (LEDs, motors, speakers) and control them from a program. Other topics will be covered as interest dictates and time permits.
